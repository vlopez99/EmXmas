            <h2>We're goin on a trip to Cincinnati</h2>
            <p>August 2nd we're gonna take a day trip to Cincinnati! We'll arrive in the early afternoon to explore the city until we go to dinner at The Incline Pub House that has a beautiful view of the whole city before enjoying the evening.</p>

            <h2>Do You Enjoy Picnics?</h2>
            <p>After our dinner, I plan to take you on a little picnic. It's nice to be able to just enjoy some time out in the sun during this beautiful Summer and relax. I actually find picnics to be pretty nice especially considering the company.</p>

            <h3>GET READY!</h3>
            <p>The best part of it all is that this is no ordinary picnic. In fact it really isn't a picnic at all! I hope you're excited because we have general admission tickets for the lawn at Riverbend Music Center where we are going to see CREED live!</p>
